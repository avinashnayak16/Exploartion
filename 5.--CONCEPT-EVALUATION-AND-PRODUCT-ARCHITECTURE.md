### 5.1 JUSTIFICATIONS FOR SCORE GIVEN

          Table 3. Justifications for score given
Design No. | Objective | Score Allocated |Justification for the Score
-- | -- | -- | --
1|Space required | 8| Due to unavailability of space for machine in factory.
||Safety | 8| It is not safe for kids.
||Time complexity | 6|Its take more time to do task.
||Efficiency | 5| It waste less energy and utilizing most of the energy in doing the task of packing and labelling.
||Ease of use | 7| Young and old people can use it easily since the machinery is not complicated.
||Portability | 5| The length of the machine is more and requires more space. 
||Use of standard parts | 7|The production of manufactured parts becomes more efficient through standards. Easier work with components.
||Cost | 8|It is not cost-effective because machinery is complex.
 2|Space required | 8| It takes more space than user required
||Safety | 8| It is safe for old and young people.
||Time complexity | 6| It does not utilize the time effectively.
||Efficiency | 5| It is not that much Efficiency which owner demand
||Ease of use | 7| It is complex so it is not user friendly.
||Portability | 5| It contain so many bigger parts because of it can't portability
||Use of standard parts | 7| For better productivity.
||Cost | 8| Standard parts are used in the machine.
  3|Space required | 8| The design of the machine is such that it requires more space
||Safety | 8|The machine is safe for adults though the machinery is complex
||Time complexity | 6|Time complexity is reduced because two robotic arms are simultaneously used which makes the work faster and more efficient.
||Efficiency | 5| The machine is efficient since it is faster and consumes less time to produce the finished product.
||Ease of use | 7|Manual work is not necessary for the system to perform the function.
||Portability | 5|It is compact compared to other designs.
||Use of standard parts | 7 | For better working  and long life of the machine. 
||Cost | 8|It is cost effectiveness.
4|Space required | 8|Length-wise space required is a bit greater
||Safety | 8|Since conveyor belts are used in the machine ,it is not completely safe for kids but is safe for adults.
||Time complexity | 6|The process is faster since the movement of box and materials is quicker(without any obstacles)
||Efficiency | 5| It take less time for labelling.
||Ease of use | 7|Though manual work is required for the machine , it is user-friendly.
||Portability | 5|The machine is not handy because it requires more space.
||Use of standard parts | 7| Utilizing standard parts is a must to ensure effective working of the machine.
||Cost | 8| Machinery is not complex and so is cost effective

01|1315 |AVINASH NAYAK| Automatic Labelling Machine| DC motor, Conveyor System, Label Dispenser, Label Sensor, Control Panel, Printer, Rewind Unit, Load Cell, Safety Sensors| The products are fed into the machine using a conveyor system. The labelling material is fed into the machine from a roll. The products are then positioned correctly on the conveyor belt which triggers a sensor to activate the labelling process. A label applicator arm then moves in and applies a label onto the product. The labelled product is then moved along the conveyor belt to the next station. The labelling system is designed to ensure that each label is applied in the correct position and orientation, regardless of the speed of the conveyor belt.| Refer the figure 1 https://youtu.be/dgxwKLsejI4|
02|1317|SNEHA TOTAD| Automatic Intermittent Cartoning Machine |Robotic arm, Steel, Chain Conveyer belt, Screw, Thin Cardboard, Wire , Switch, Indication |The machine erects the cartons by folding and gluing them. The products are inserted into the cartons. The cartons are closed with flaps by either tucking or gluing. The finished cartons or boxes are discharged from the machine. The intermittent motion principle of this machine allows it to perform these stages one at a time, stopping between each stage to ensure proper positioning and accuracy. The machine is fully automated and controlled by a programmable logic controller (PLC) which enables it to adjust to different product sizes and shapes.| Refer the figure 2 https://youtu.be/84o_Nf3GzE0|
03|1343|SAMARTH ANGADI| Packaging Machine Wrapper| Coil ,DC motor ,Plastic, sensors, Conveyer belt, Display, Adjusting screw |The machine working starts with a cylindrical roll of film. The flow wrapping machine will transfer the film from the roll and through to the forming collar(sometimes referred to as tube or flow). At the same time, a conveyor has lined up individual products for wrapping. The film is fed through the collar and the product is surrounded with film, sealed and the film is then cut. The finished individual product is then gathered downstream to be bagged or cartooned prior to boxing and palletizing. Suitable for all kinds of product packaging. Including medical supplies, vegetables and meat, snacks and candy.| Refer the figure 3 https://youtu.be/M0XL_KMqQW4|
04|1364|POOJA NEKAR| Semiautomatic spices packing machine| Conveyer belt ,weighing machine ,DC motor ,Buttons, Chain, Plastic bag |A bulk amount of spice is put in a medium sized bowl and Provision is made to fill calculated amount of spices in a metal sheet packet from the bowl which is handled manually. The packet is sensed by sensors and the packet is filled with spices. Once the packet is filled, the packet is moved towards the sealing facility which is also done manually. The sealing is automatic.| Refer the figure 4 https://youtu.be/P10u0dDThgw|
